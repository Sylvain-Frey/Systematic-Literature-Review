Getting Started with Google App Engine and Clojure,"Bedra, A.",Relevance,"Internet Computing, IEEE",July-Aug. 2010,2010,14,4,85,88,"Over the past two years (2008-2010), Clojure (http:// clojure.org) has made quite a splash in two areas: functional programming and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Clojure is a Lisp implementation on the JVM, offering its users significant elegance, simplicity, and power. Although Clojure is a fairly young language, it's extremely well thought out and mature, with a vibrant community of talented and friendly people using and contributing to it. If you're targeting the JVM as your platform, you're doing yourself a disservice by not considering Clojure as an option. That being said, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and you must decide for yourself. So, let's take a look at Compojure, a Web framework built on the Clojure language, and see how to create and deploy a Compojure application on the Google App Engine platform.",1089-7801,,,10.1109/MIC.2010.92,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5496809,Clojure;Web development;app engine;functional programming,Functional programming;Java;Search engines;Virtual machining,Java;LISP;search engines;virtual machines,Clojure;Compojure;Google App Engine;Java Virtual Machine;Lisp;Web framework;functional programming,,,,6,,1,,,20100628,,IEEE,IEEE Computer Society,IEEE Journals & Magazines,Accepted,
Clojure Templating Libraries: Fleet and Enlive,"Vanderburg, G.",InfoEther,"Internet Computing, IEEE",Sept.-Oct. 2010,2010,14,5,87,90,"Last issue, Aaron Bedra wrote about Compojure, a Clojure-based Web framework. Here, I follow up on his article, delving into one particular aspect of Web development using Clojure and Compojure: templating. On a recent project, I had the pleasure of working with Bedra, using Compojure. I had done Clojure programming before, but that project was the first time I had used it for Web development. One of the earliest decisions we had to make was which templating system to use.",1089-7801,,,10.1109/MIC.2010.111,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5562497,Clojure;Web development;functional programming;template languages;template systems;templating,Cloud computing;HTML;Indexes;Java;Libraries;Object oriented modeling;Rendering (computer graphics),Internet;libraries,Clojure templating libraries;Clojure-based Web framework;Compojure templating;Enlive;Fleet,,,,1,,1,,,20100902,,IEEE,IEEE Computer Society,IEEE Journals & Magazines,Borderline,
Clojure for Number Crunching on Multicore Machines,"Kalin, M.; Miller, D.",,Computing in Science & Engineering,Nov.-Dec. 2012,2012,14,6,12,23,"Clojure is a Lisp language designed to run on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and interoperate automatically with all Java libraries. However, compared to Java, Clojure has a concurrency API that encourages programmers to take advantage of multicore architectures through multithreading, but Clojure doesn't burden programmers with low-level thread-coordination tasks.",1521-9615,,,10.1109/MCSE.2012.69,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6235943,Java;Lisp;concurrency;multithreading;multiversion concurrency control;scientific computing;software transactional memory;synchronization,Computer languages;Concurrent computing;Instruction sets;Java;Libraries;Programming,Java;LISP;application program interfaces;concurrency control;multi-threading;multiprocessing systems;software libraries;virtual machines,Clojure;JVM;Java library;Java virtual machine;Lisp language;concurrency API;multicore architecture;multicore machine;multithreading;number crunching,,,,0,,,,2012-07-10,20121110,,IEEE,American Institute of Physics;IEEE Computer Society,IEEE Journals & Magazines,Rejected,off topic
