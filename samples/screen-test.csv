1,2012,"Zhang, X.; Phillips, C. I.; Mondragon, R.J.",Topology Construction of Provider-Independent Overlays to Improve Internet Resilience,"In this letter, we focus on topology construction of provider-independent overlays to improve the resilience of the Internet. A provider-independent overlay is usually deployed across a multi-provider network. If the underlying network has a similar topology to that of the AS-level Internet, we show that the overlay resilience is very close to the optimal solution if the overlay connectivity is described by a regular graph. We arrive at this conclusion based on extensive simulations comparing the performance of various overlay construction algorithms exploiting well-known AS-level Internet topology datasets.",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6317114
2,2012,"Cetinkaya, E.K.; Alenazi, M.J.F.; Rohrer, J.P.; Sterbenz, J.P.G.",Topology connectivity analysis of internet infrastructure using graph spectra,"Understanding and modelling the Internet has been a major research challenge in part due to the complexity of the interaction among its protocols and in part due to multilevel, multidomain topological structure. It is therefore crucial to properly analyse each structural level of the Internet to gain a better understanding, as well as to improve its resilience properties. In this paper, first we present the physical and logical topologies of two ISPs and compare these topologies with the US interstate highway topology by using graph metrics and then using the normalised Laplacian spectrum. Our results indicate that physical network topologies are closely correlated with the motorway transportation topology. Finally, we study the spectral properties of various communication networks and observe that the spectral radius of the normalised Laplacian matrix is a good indicator of graph connectivity when comparing different size and order graphs.",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6459764
3,2010,"Cetinkaya, E.K.; Broyles, D.; Dandekar, A.; Srinivasan, S.; Sterbenz, J.P.G.",A comprehensive framework to simulate network attacks and challenges,"Communication networks have evolved tremendously over the past several decades, offering a multitude of services while becoming an essential critical infrastructure in our daily lives. Networks in general, and the Internet in particular face a number of challenges to normal operation, including attacks and large-scale disasters, as well as due to the characteristics of the mobile wireless communication environment. It is therefore vital to have a framework and methodology for understanding the impact of challenges to harden current networks and improve the design of future networks. In this paper, we present a framework to evaluate network dependability and performability in the face of challenges. This framework uses ns-3 simulation as the methodology for analysis of the effects of perturbations to normal operation of the networks, with a challenge specification applied to the network topology. This framework can simulate both static and dynamic challenges based on the failure or wireless-impairment of individual components, as well as modelling geographically-correlated failures. We demonstrate this framework with the Sprint Rocketfuel and synthetically generated topologies as well as a wireless example, to show that this framework can provide valuable insight for the analysis and design of resilient networks.",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5676585
4,2013,"Kien Nguyen; Quang Tran Minh; Yamada, S.",Towards Optimal Disaster Recovery in Backbone Networks,"Fast recovering backbone networks from failures caused by unexpected disasters is critical to enhance the Internet resilience. The major challenge is fast switchover traffic from a faulty path to an alternative one. In this paper, we present an approach toward achieving a zero switchover time (i.e., optimal) by using two emerging technologies: Multipath TCP (MPTCP) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN). The conceptual idea is keeping multiple concurrent paths in an end-to-end communication, which is continuously alive unless all the paths get failure. Besides that, when a disaster occurs, traffic engineering is adopted to quickly balance the traffic on available paths. In order to establishes the concurrent paths, MPTCP divides an application's byte stream into multiple TCP subflows, each of which is forwarded in an end-to-end route. The routes are normally determined by IP routing protocols, such as OSPF or BGP, which have two disadvantages. The first one is the protocols always take long time to reestablish new routes in disasters (i.e., long convergence time). The second one is they are originally designed without traffic engineering. On the other hand, SDN enables the use of central controllers with global view of dynamic network state. In addition, the controllers can remotely controls both direction and capacity of traffic flows in many flexible ways (i.e., using OpenFlow). Therefore, SDN potentially solves the disadvantages of IP routing protocols.",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6649927
5,2004,"Chen, J.; Trajkovic, L.",Analysis of Internet topology data,"Discovering Internet topology is important for analyzing routing protocols and Internet robustness and resilience. Recent research results dealing with Internet topology, such as the discovery of power-laws and the application of normalized Laplacian analysis to Internet topology data, have increased the need for more complete datasets and their more rigorous interpretations. In this paper, we examine datasets from two sources: Route Views and RIPE. We show that each dataset may have a geographical bias and, consequently, consist of distinct routes. Furthermore, by employing normalized Laplacian analysis, we identify distinct cluster characteristics that could not be inferred by directly examining the collected data.",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1329082
6,2009,"Tranoris, C.; Denazis, S.; Gavras, A.",A workflow on the dynamic composition and distribution of orchestration for testbed provisioning,"Pan-European laboratory (Panlab) is based on a federation of distributed interconnected testbeds, providing access to platforms, networks and services for testing. Core components of Panlab is a tool called Â¿TeagleÂ¿ which provides the means for a customer to express the testing needs and the Panlab testbed manager (PTM) which implements the interactions between the set-up and configuration requests by Teagle and the components in the testbed it manages. This paper discusses a solution and proposes a workflow for distributing the federation's intelligence during provisioning not only to Teagle but also to each testbed (each PTM), where local issues like policies, dependencies, constraints and even availability must be solved. Among other application areas, the dynamic provisioning of testbed resources is important in the area of experimentation for future Internet resilience.",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5345341
